# Welcome to SunCalc!

Welcome to **SunCalc**. This calculator uses Reverse Polish Notation. This is **not** a calculator used to find sun and moon information. It is called SunCalc because it is a calculator followed before my name, Sunny.

## Reverse Polish Notation

What is Reverse Polish Notation? It is when you type the operator after the operands. For example

	2 2 +

SunCalc would print out

	2.0 + 2.0 = 4.0

However, some functions don't require a second number. For example

	16 !

Suncalc would print out

	16.0! = 2.0922789888E13
You can find out more about Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
## Functions

SunCalc can handle trigonometry and irrational numbers. A list of functions can be found [here](https://bit.ly/SunCalcFunctions).

>The functions found in gray cannot be used in CodeHS

## Developers

SunCalc was made thanks to [SoneyBun](https://github.com/SoneyBun) and [Skeledan](https://github.com/TheRealSkeledan). It is actively getting updated. Find more or even talk to us in the Discord server.

## Discord Server

The [SunCode Discord server](https://bit.ly/SunCode) is a little fun laid back community hangout that also has a passion for all things computer science and cybersecurity.

## GitHub Repository

The GitHub repository for SunCalc can be found [here](https://github.com/SoneyBun/SunCalc). It contains all the code and a zipped file for SunCalc using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org).

##  SunCalcHealth

SunCalc implements [SunCalcHealth](https://github.com/SoneyBun/BMICalculator) for the BMI Calculator and Height Estimate feature.

> Type "health" to access it.

## Supported Irrational Numbers

SunCalc has a library of Irrational numbers that is constantly getting updated. You can view it in Irrational.java

## Factorial (!)

As it is impossible to do the factorial of a negative and the factorial of a non-integer, if a negative non-integer was entered along with the factorial operator. It will tell you the mistakes and give you both the positive, the rounded and/or truncated of the factorial.

## ans/answer, ans2/answer2

For when you get two numbers on a factorial, you may use ans and ans2. ans can be used on almost every operator, except those that return booleans.

## esc, escape

SunCalc runs until an error or until the user types esc, or escape.

## Who am I?
I'm Sunny. I've been programming for around 4 years now. I can program in the following languages, in order from most fluent to least.
* Java
* Lua
* Python

Coding is my passion as the thought of building something huge from nothing but an empty file is insane.

I love to play video games. Roblox being one of my favorites. I like to listen to music, maybe we have a similar taste?
